I have a request that involves comparing two JSON objects. The first object is comes from a data download from the FAA. The second object is what this application receives from the Stratux ADS-B receiver websocket. The FAA version is pre-processed with everything parsed out. The goal is to write a javascript file with functions that will assist in converting object two format into object one format. The objects are listed below.

Object one: {
                    "raw_text": "MMCN 290140Z 18007KT 10SM FEW100 BKN200 32/23 A2990 RMK 8/063 HZY DSNT CB 1ST AND 2ND QUAD",
                    "station_id": "MMCN",
                    "observation_time": "2025-08-29T01:40:00Z",
                    "latitude": 27.395,
                    "longitude": -109.837,
                    "temp_c": 32,
                    "dewpoint_c": 23,
                    "wind_dir_degrees": 180,
                    "wind_speed_kt": 7,
                    "visibility_statute_mi": "10+",
                    "altim_in_hg": 29.9,
                    "sky_condition": [
                        {
                            "sky_cover": "FEW",
                            "cloud_base_ft_agl": "10000"
                        },
                        {
                            "sky_cover": "BKN",
                            "cloud_base_ft_agl": "20000"
                        }
                    ],
                    "flight_category": "VFR",
                    "metar_type": "METAR",
                    "elevation_m": 57
                }

Object two: {"Type":"METAR","Location":"KLUM","Time":"061955Z","Data":"AUTO 01009KT 10SM SCT046 SCT055 BKN065 28/18 A2996  \n     RMK AO2 T02840179 PWINO=\n","LocaltimeReceived":"0001-01-01T09:35:31.87Z"}

Please use the field names from Object one for the output. If possible, create a new file called weatherconverter.js containing whatever code is needed to perform this operation.  

Thank You.
